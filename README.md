- 🤔 About me: I became interested in programming around 2012. I am self-taught dev. I was mainly focused on C++ and C#, then shifted to web dev.
- I've done mostly small and medium projects, but I have 2 bigger projects on my account - enhanced editor for Supreme Ruler game and Simple University System (SUS), meant to showcase solutions to my university's system problems.
I speak both English and Polish, so feel free to write to me ^^
