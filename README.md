- 🤔 About me: I became interested in programming around 2012. I've started as a self-taught dev. I was mainly focused on C++ and C#, then shifted to TS. Then I finished my bachelor degree in Computer Science and started full time job as a web dev using Vue, TS and PHP.
- I've done mostly small and medium projects, but I have 2 bigger projects on my account - enhanced editor for Supreme Ruler game and Simple University System (SUS), meant to showcase solutions to my university's system problems.
I speak both English and Polish, so feel free to write to me ^^
